## enki Web Services for Games on Python Google App Engine

A permissively licensed Python web service for games developers. enkiWS is a library for setting up a website and ancillary services for games on Google App Engine. GAE was chosen as the platform since it provides a low cost scalable solution.

## Instructions

### Running the enkiWS website locally

You can run enkiWS on your machine using the Google App Engine Launcher:  

1. Download & extract [enkiWS](https://github.com/juliettef/enkiWS/archive/master.zip)  
1. Download & install [Google App Engine with python 2.7](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python)  
1. Run GoogleAppEngineLauncher:  
    1. Choose File > Add Existing Application.  
    1. Set the Application Path to the directory enkiWS was extracted to (where the app.yaml file resides)  
    1. Select Add - enkiWS is added to the list of project.
1. In the GAE Launcher select enkiWS, press Run, then press Browse - the enkiWS site opens in your browser.  

### Debugging enkiWS locally using PyCharm CE

A *.idea* directory is included in the project. It is preconfigured to enable the use of the free Pycharm Community Edition as an IDE for debugging python GAE code, with one modification to make manually. 
Note: if you'd prefer to configure PyCharm CE yourself see the [detailed tutorial](http://www.enkisoftware.com/devlogpost-20141231-1-Python_Google_App_Engine_debugging_with_PyCharm_CE.html). Otherwise follow the simplified instructions below:

1. Ensure you have python 2.7 and Google app Engine installed. To check it works, try running the enkiWS website locally.  
1. Download and install [Pycharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)  
1. Start Pycharm and open the project - set the project location to the directory enkiWS was extracted to (the parent folder of the .idea directory).  
1. A *Load error: undefined path variables*, *GAE_PATH is undefined* warning is displayed. To fix it see the [PyCharm tutorial Method A step 5 onwards](http://www.enkisoftware.com/devlogpost-20141231-1-Python_Google_App_Engine_debugging_with_PyCharm_CE.html#pathvariable).
1. Note: if you get a message stating *No Python interpreter configured for the project*, go to File > Settings > Project:enkiWS > Project Interpreter and set the project interpreter to point to the location of *python.exe* on your computer (..\Python27\python.exe).
1. Restart PyCharm
1. You can now run / debug the project from PyCharm using one of the configurations provided (e.g. *GAE_config*).  

### Enabling OAuth login with Google, Facebook, Twitter

To set up Open Authentication, you need to configure secrets.py:  

1. Follow the instructions in [example_secrets.txt](https://github.com/juliettef/enkiWS/blob/master/example_secrets.txt)  
1. Go to the login page: you will see the login buttons for the providers you've set up. Clicking on those buttons creates and account &/or logs you into enkiWS using OAuth.  

Notes:  

 - Valve's Steam is always available since it doesn't require a client Id nor secret.  
 - When you navigate the enkiWS site you will no longer see the warning message stating that the setup is incomplete.  


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why use Google App Engine?

Small games developers like ourselves typically have very irregular backend requirements - website and service traffic are typically relatively low, but spike when there's a new release or if some content goes viral. Google App Engine (GAE) provides a low cost scalable solution for this scenario. For more information see our article on [Implementing a static website in Google App Engine](http://www.enkisoftware.com/devlogpost-20130823-1-Implementing_a_static_website_in_Google_App_Engine.html) or [Wolfire's article on GAE for indie developers](http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/03/google-app-engine-for-indie-developers/) as well as [Wolfire's article on hosting the Humble Indie Bundle](http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/06/Hosting-the-Humble-Indie-Bundle-on-App-Engine).

### Why Python?

Python is sufficiently popular and easy to use that it made a convenient choice of language from those available on Google App Engine. We considered Google's Go language, but although it has many benefits we thought it would be less widely known in the game development community.

### EU Cookie law?
According to the [EU legislation on cookies](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm#section_2), the cookies used in enkiWS are exempt from consent.
